# Topic Modeling on Covid-19 Research Papers
Abstract:
This paper studies the different topic clustering techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA), Latent Dirichlet allocation(LDA) and Top2Vec on a set of COVID-19 research papers. Several text-preprocessing methods like stop-word removal, creating bigrams and trigrams, and lemmatization are used before the modelling. Python is used for programming and the internal performance measures are evaluated using coherence measure and visualized for comparison.

Work:
Every organization involves most of its operational data in an unreadable form. The process of transforming unstructured data into a structured or readable format is challenging. Clustering plays a crucial role here and visualizes the processed information to the end-user. Topic modelling is an unsupervised clustering technique, which is capable of studying a collection of documents, identifying words and phrase patterns within the content, and automatically grouping words and similar expressions that best describes a set of documents. In the fields of text mining and information retrieval, topic models have a wide range of applications such as text categorization, tag recommendation, information filtering, keyword extraction, and similarity search. 

In this work, around 3000 COVID-19 research papers are selected for topic modelling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Top2Vec models are applied for comparison, which can handle discrete data. Since the selected set includes research papers, the content of the text is considered fully informative. An unsupervised clustering technique is implemented on the research abstract without taking any ground truth into consideration.
